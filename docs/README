Shell Tester is a test suite for Bourne-compatible shells.
It consists of a number shell scripts that are expected to be
run under a known-good shell. Each script invokes the shell
being tested with a script and possibly some input or files.
It captures the standard output, standard error, and exit
status of the shell being tested, then compares those to
the expected values.
