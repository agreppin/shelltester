Shell Tester is a test suite for Bourne-compatible shells.
It consists of a number of test cases, each of which runs
a small program using the shell to be tested. The standard
output, standard error, and exit status of the shell are
recorded and compared to the expected values.

How To Use

To use shell tester, first run the configure script and
tell it the shell to test:

  ./configure --shell-to-test /bin/sh

Then run ~make check~ to run the tests. You can use the -j
option to make to run multiple tests in parallel. For
example:

  make -j 8 check
